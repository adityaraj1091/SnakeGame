## Homework:
You can continue working on this project if you like. One feature you can add is a keyListener in KeyPressed to restart the game every time there is a game over. ex) if (e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_SPACE && gameOver). Inside this conditional statement, you should reset the game to default (clear snakeBody ArrayList, call placeFood(), etc). Another feature you can add after this is keep track of the high score and paint it below the current score. For this you will need a variable to keep track of high score.

## My Contribution:
1. Remove the grid lines for a better user experience.
2. Add a feature that players can restart the game.
3. add a new feature that Player can pause/resume the game.
